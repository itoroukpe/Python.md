## Lesson 3: Reading journals from food critics
In this lesson, you'll use AI to decide whether the contents of a file are about food and restaurants.

Text data like emails, journal entries, and social media posts often have no predefined structure. Additionally, each person writes in their own style: some use bullet points, while others prefer long paragraphs. For this reason, text data is known as unstructured data.

Let's start by loading some helper functions to use in the notebook:
```bash
from helper_functions import get_llm_response, print_llm_response
```
### Working with text data
You'll take look at journal entries in the working directory. The journals are stored as plain text files with extension `.txt'.

Start by opening and reading the Cape Town journal:
```bash
f = open("cape_town.txt", "r")
journal_cape_town = f.read()
f.close()
```
Print the contents of the journal:
```bash
print(journal_cape_town)
```
As you can see, the file is about restaurants and food.

Next, open the Tokyo journal entry file and read its contents:
```
f = open("tokyo.txt", "r")
journal_tokyo = f.read() 
f.close()
```
Print the contents of the journal:
```bash
print(journal_tokyo)
```
This entry is also about restaurants and food - but notice how different the format of the journal is from the Cape Town example!

### Determining if text files are relevant using LLMs
In this section, you'll write a prompt that instructs an LLM to determine whether a file content is about food and restaurants or some other topic.

Define the prompt and include the Tokyo journal entry as the input data to check:
```bash
prompt = f"""Respond with "Relevant" or "Not relevant": 
the journal describes restaurants and their specialties. 
​
Journal:
{journal_tokyo}"""
```
Print the LLM response to see if the file is relevant for our purpose or not:
```bash
print_llm_response(prompt)
```
### Checking all files using a for loop
Using Python and an LLM together allows you to quickly iterate over multiple files and check the relevance of the content for your tasks.

Start by creating a list of all the files you want to check:
```bash
# List of the journal files
files = ["cape_town.txt", "madrid.txt", "rio_de_janeiro.txt", "sydney.txt", "tokyo.txt"]
```
Next, use a for loop to open each file and have an LLM check if the content from that file is relevant to food and restaurants.

If you need a refresher on for loops, please revisit Course 2!
```bash
for file in files:
    # Read journal file for the city
    f = open(file, "r")
    journal = f.read()
    f.close()
​
    # Create prompt
    prompt = f"""Respond with "Relevant" or "Not relevant": 
    the journal describes restaurants and their specialties. 
​
    Journal:
    {journal}"""
​
    # Use LLM to determine if the journal entry is useful
    print(f"{file} -> {get_llm_response(prompt)}")
```
It seems that the Madrid journal entry is not relevant. Let's print its contents to see why the LLM flagged it as "not relevant":

# Here you can check the content from any journal entry
```bash
f = open("madrid.txt", "r") 
print(f.read()) 
f.close()
```
The Madrid journal entry doesn't contain information about restaurants to try. Instead, it is a description of the economy of the city.

I am using AI to determine whether different texts are "relevant" or "not relevant" using an LLM. Does this task have a specific name in AI?

### Extra practice
Experiment with different prompts to check whether files are of interest to you or not. Below is the example suggested in the video - try running it first. Then, try each exercise.

### Exercise 1
Change the prompt to classify the text for different topics, for example "mentions a dessert" or "describes the restaurant design."
```bash
files = ["cape_town.txt", "madrid.txt", "rio_de_janeiro.txt", 
         "sydney.txt", "tokyo.txt"]
​
for file in files:
    # Read journal file for the city
    f = open(file, "r")
    journal = f.read()
    f.close()
​
    # TRY CHANGING THIS PROMPT TO ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS
    prompt = f"""Respond with "Yes" or "No": 
    the journal describes restaurants and food dishes. 
​
    Journal:
    {journal}"""
​
    # Use LLM to determine if the journal entry is useful
    print(f"{file} -> {get_llm_response(prompt)}")
```
### Exercise 2
Using the same code below, change the prompt to classify into more than two categories.

Example:

mentions a vegetarian dish
mentions a vegan dish
mentions both
mentions neither
```bash
files = ["cape_town.txt", "madrid.txt", "rio_de_janeiro.txt", 
         "sydney.txt", "tokyo.txt"]
​
for file in files:
    # Read journal file for the city
    f = open(file, "r")
    journal = f.read()
    f.close()
​
    # TRY CHANGING THIS PROMPT TO ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS
    prompt = f"""Respond with "Yes" or "No": 
    the journal describes restaurants and food dishes. 
​
    Journal:
    {journal}"""
​
    # Use LLM to determine if the journal entry is useful
    print(f"{file} -> {get_llm_response(prompt)}")
```
